Big Cms is a ready to use Yii 2 web application with frontend and backend. It provides a solid foundation for building complex
Yii2 sites because it's easy to extend and doesn't impose any rules. Big Cms is as much a toolset as a Cms and it's created
to make better products faster.

Big Cms is based on Yii 2 modules and a concept of `Blocks`. It's easy to create your own blocks and integrate them with Big Cms.
Big Cms is designed to compatible with any Yii2 module/extension mainly because no specific classes needs to be extended.

Big Cms is built with a flexibility that makes it suitable as a starting-kit but also prepared for shared hosts.

Dynamic themes <span id="bigcms-templates"></span>
-----------------------------------
Yii2 themes are used to style pages individually by assigning blocks to positions. This is done by adding `include statement`s
to layout files. An `include statement` specifies a position in a theme where one or more blocks will be inserted by Big Cms.
In the backend of Big Cms blocks are added to position by drag 'n drop.

Read the [guide on dynamic themes](http://www.bigbrush-agency.com/guide/guide-themes.html) for more information.
